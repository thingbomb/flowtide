  **Prerequisites**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [PNPM](https://pnpm.io), and a
  browser
</Info>

## Building the app

Follow these steps to build Flowtide from source on your system:

**Step 1**: Clone the repository with Git:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash http
  git clone https://github.com/thingbomb/flowtide
  ```

```bash ssh
git clone git@github.com:thingbomb/flowtide.git
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Install the packages with [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm install
```

**Step 3**: Build the app:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash chrome
  pnpm build:chrome
  ```

```bash firefox
pnpm build:firefox
```

```bash web
pnpm build:web
```

</CodeGroup>

Check the `apps/new-tab/dist` folder for the app.

## Running the code on Chrome

Once you have completed your build, go to `chrome://extensions` in your Chromium-based browser and select "Load unpacked". Select the `dist` folder and you're done. Open a new tab to see the result.

<Info>Developer mode must be enabled for "Load unpacked" to work</Info>

## Running the code on Firefox

Once you have completed your Firefox build, zip up the `dist` folder. Once done, go to `about:addons` in your Gecko-based browser. Select "Install Add-on from file..." and select the ZIP archive. You should be done. Open a new tab to see the result.

# Contributing

Head on over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thingbomb/flowtide) and fork it. Clone the repo on your local machine and start developing.

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

<CodeGroup />

<Info>
  This will open the web version which is a version without the permissions of
  Chrome so bookmarks and other functionality exclusive to browser APIs will not
  work. If you need to test a new feature that requires those, follow the steps
  to Build the app.
</Info>

Go to the URL it shows and start developing the app. Once you are done making your changing, push them to GitHub, and file a pull request.
