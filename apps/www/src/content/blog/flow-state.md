Regarding productivity, I have always struggled with distractions and falling behind on tasks due to a lack of focus.

However, after much trial and error, I have discovered the key principles for entering and staying in a flow state - where I am fully engaged and efficient in my work.

In this article, I will dive into the three key principles to enter and stay in your flow state.

## Conquer the first task

The first and most crucial principle is conquering the initial task. Completing the first task gives you a sense of accomplishment and motivation, making it easier to complete your other tasks in a flow state.

## Don't give up

It is key not to give up and only focus on easy tasks, as this will not challenge you and may hinder your ability to enter a flow state. Instead, tackling challenging tasks can significantly boost your momentum, helping you to stay in the flow.

## Don't get pulled away

When you're in the flow state, you must be fully present in your work. Anything distracting from your task can significantly disrupt your flow and productivity.

That's it. I hope this will help you to be more focused. I know it has helped me.
